# How to Create a Wallet

Creating a cryptocurrency wallet is the first step to accepting crypto donations. This guide walks you through the process.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Create Wallet

From your dashboard, click **"Create Wallet"** or navigate to the Wallets page and click the **"+ Create Wallet"** button.

### 2. Choose Your Cryptocurrency

Select which cryptocurrency you want to accept:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)** - The original cryptocurrency, widely accepted
- **USDC** - A stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (less price volatility)

### 3. Add a Label (Optional)

Give your wallet a friendly name like:
- "Sunday Offering"
- "Building Fund"
- "Mission Trip Donations"

This helps you organize multiple wallets.

### 4. Save Your Seed Phrase

**CRITICAL:** Your seed phrase is shown ONCE. You must save it securely.

- Write it down on paper
- Store in a safe place
- Never share it with anyone
- Never store it digitally (not in email, cloud, etc.)

### 5. Verify Your Seed Phrase

You'll be asked to confirm 3 random words from your seed phrase to ensure you wrote it down correctly.

### 6. Wallet Created!

Your wallet is now ready to receive donations. You can:

- View the wallet address
- Generate QR codes
- Share with donors

## Important Security Notes

⚠️ **Your seed phrase is the ONLY way to recover your wallet**

If you lose it, you lose access to all funds permanently. We do NOT store your seed phrase (non-custodial system).
